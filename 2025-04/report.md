HACKTIVISM COALITIONS: PATTERNS OF COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS (APR 2025)

This report provides an overview of the key hacktivist groups that played prominent roles during the cyber offensive that followed Operation Sindoor, an Indian military response to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack. In retaliation, a coordinated wave of cyberattacks was launched by pro-Pakistan and aligned hacktivist actors targeting Indian digital infrastructure. Among the most active and strategically significant was AnonSec, which emerged as a central coordination hub within a coalition of at least 16 groups, enabling rapid deployment of DDoS attacks, website defacements, and data breaches. Similarly, Electronic Army Special Forces (EASF) led targeted campaigns against Indian government institutions, leveraging phishing, malware, and propaganda alongside other pro-Pakistan factions. Notably, the pro-Russian group NoName, typically aligned with anti-NATO interests, appeared linked to the broader threat landscape, illustrating the complex and transnational nature of modern hacktivist alliances.

üë®‚Äçüíª ANON SEC

‚óΩ During Operation Sindoor (April‚ÄìMay 2025), the pro-Pakistan hacktivist group played a central role in coordinating cyberattacks against Indian institutions. As illustrated in the April 2025 Hacktivist Coalition map, AnonSec served as a leading hub group, directly connected to at least 16 other groups.

‚óΩ This extensive network enabled rapid mobilization and tactical coordination of DDoS attacks, website defacements, and data breach operations during the cyber offensive, amplifying AnonSec‚Äôs impact as a strategic threat actor.

‚óΩ Operation Sindoor was an Indian military response to a terror attack in Pahalgam in April 2025. In retaliation, a wave of cyberattacks was launched by pro-Pakistan hacktivist groups targeting Indian digital infrastructure. 


üë®‚Äçüíª ELECTRONIC ARMY SPECIAL FORCES (EASF)

‚óΩ Pro-Pakistani hacktivist group that has gained prominence in recent cyber offensives against Indian digital infrastructure, particularly following the Pahalgam terror attack and India's subsequent Operation Sindoor in April 2025.

‚óΩ The group is known for targeting Indian government institutions through DDoS attacks, website defacements, and unverified data breach claims. Operating primarily via Telegram and X, EASF coordinates cyber campaigns that include phishing, malware deployment, and propaganda dissemination, often in collaboration with other pro-Pakistani groups. 

‚óΩ Their actions contribute to the escalating cyber tensions between India and Pakistan, underscoring the growing influence of non-state actors in geopolitical cyber conflicts.


üë®‚Äçüíª NONAME

‚óΩ Pro-Russian hacktivist group that emerged in early 2022 following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The group primarily conducts DDoS attacks targeting government, media, and critical infrastructure websites in countries perceived as hostile to Russian interests, especially NATO members and Ukraine allies.

‚óΩ During Operation Sindoor, NoName was observed interacting with or being connected to other hacktivist groups involved in the cyber offensives against India, as seen in recent hacktivist coalition maps.
