## 📁 Structure

Content is organized in monthly folders. Each folder includes:
- 📄 An analytical text describing major coalitions and active campaigns

## 🎯 Purpose

To analyze how hacktivist actors form coalitions and operate across cyberspace, supported by graph-driven and link analysis, focusing on geopolitical campaigns, symbolic hacktivism, decentralized cyber conflicts, and their relevance to threat detection, attribution, and strategic forecasting. This repository aims to support analysts, researchers, and defenders in identifying patterns, motivations, and tactics used in hacktivist cyber offensives.

## 🌍 Scope

- Hacktivist groups across ideological and regional boundaries  
- Analysis of support infrastructure (C2, forums, communication channels)  
- Connections between cyber events and real-world conflicts  
- Tactical patterns and narrative themes
