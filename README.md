This repository is a personal initiative dedicated to documenting, analyzing, and visualizing global hacktivist coalitions.

## 📁 Structure

Content is organized in monthly folders. Each folder includes:
- 📄 An analytical text describing major coalitions and active campaigns
- 🖼️ An illustrative image showing the dynamics of the coalitions

## 🎯 Purpose

To build an open knowledge base for understanding how hacktivist groups organize, collaborate, and communicate — with a focus on geopolitical campaigns, symbolic hacktivism, and decentralized cyber conflicts.

## 🌍 Scope

- Hacktivist groups across ideological and regional boundaries  
- Analysis of support infrastructure (C2, forums, communication channels)  
- Connections between cyber events and real-world conflicts  
- Tactical patterns and narrative themes
