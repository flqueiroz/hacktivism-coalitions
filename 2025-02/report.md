HACKTIVISM COALITIONS: PATTERNS OF COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN GROUPS (FEV 2025)

■ My Hacktivism Coalition Diagram for February 2025 presents the changing structure of cyber activist alliances, showing how different hacking groups are connected. These groups have formed partnerships despite having different goals and operating in various regions.

📍 KEY INSIGHTS

■ Akatsuki Cyber Team (highlighted in yellow) is a central node connecting multiple hacktivist groups. This group would serve as a bridge between different factions, allowing it to influence attacks, recruitment, and tool-sharing. These strategic partnerships would indicate Akatsuki Cyber Team's intent to expand its influence and operational capabilities within the hacktivist community.

■ By forming alliances with other hacktivist groups, Akatsuki Cyber Team has carried out coordinated cyber offensives targeting interests in Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Mali, Nepal, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, Ukraine, UK, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.

■ In a hub-centric hacktivist coalition, secondary groups serve as minor connections, extending the influence of a main hub group:

👨‍💻 RABBIT CYBER TEAM;

👨‍💻 CYBER TEAM INDONESIA;

👨‍💻 H4x0r Umbrella Corp; 

👨‍💻 Maroccan Black Cyber Army; and

👨‍💻 Dark Storm Team.

■ On March 10, 2025, the Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the DDoS attack against X (formerly Twitter) via a Telegram post, sharing a screenshot of a real-time connectivity status page showing failed connection attempts worldwide. Formed in 2023, the pro-Palestinian group has previously declared its intent to launch cyber offensives against government websites belonging to NATO countries, Israel, and states allied with Israel. 

❗ Note: Due to the covert offensive actions of hacktivist groups, information is continually evolving. Continuous monitoring and updated intelligence are essential for an accurate understanding of their activities.​
